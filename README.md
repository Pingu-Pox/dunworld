Hail pals of kin, and kin of my pals!

Welcome to our Foundry-hosted Palworld modpack.

# Note
This is a modpack made for the Steam version of Palworld, other game stores are not supported currently (gamepass, etc.)

## Installation:
1. Download and install Vortex Mod Manager (for managing your mods from Nexus Mods)
2. Launch Vortex Mod Manager, if it complains about not having .NET, have it fix/install it for you.
3. Go to Games, search for "Palworld", hover over the game's tile and click "manage". It will tell you that you need an extension to do this, confirm that. If Vortex gets stuck trying to setup Palworld, click cancel and do it again.
4. Vortex might not find Palworld based on where you installed Palworld or Vortex, so help it find the Palworld directory where the "Pal" and "Engine" folders are (e.g., C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Palworld). 
5. Choose Steam as your game store. Windows might ask for permission to continue the setup.
6. Browse to the collection and add it to your Vortex Mod Manager: https://next.nexusmods.com/palworld/collections/abwnwl/revisions/1?tab=about&utm_source=copy&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share_collection
7. After the collection is installed and enabled, check the notification center at the top right for any warnings, such as needing deployment (you want to allow these to perform).
8. Once everything is enabled, and you have no new notifications in the notification center, launch the game!

Currently you can try the modpack in **single-player**.
