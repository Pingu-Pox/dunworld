Greetings, pals of kin and kin of pals! We're thrilled to introduce our Foundry-hosted Palworld modpack.

## Important Note:
This modpack is designed exclusively for the **Steam** version of Palworld. Other platforms (Game Pass, etc.) are not currently supported.

## Server Address:
Coming soon:tm:

## Installation Instructions:

1. **Download and Install [Vortex Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/)** (for managing mods from Nexus Mods).
2. Launch Vortex. If prompted to install .NET, let it handle the installation.
3. In Vortex, go to the "Games" tab, search for **Palworld**, hover over the game's tile, and click "Manage". You’ll be prompted to install an extension—accept the prompt. If Vortex gets stuck during setup, click "Cancel" and try again.
4. If Vortex can’t automatically detect your Palworld installation, manually locate the directory where the "Pal" and "Engine" folders are (e.g., `C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Palworld`).
5. Select **Steam** as your game store. Windows may ask for permission to continue.
6. Add the mod collection to Vortex by following [this link](https://next.nexusmods.com/palworld/collections/abwnwl/revisions/1?tab=about&utm_source=copy&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share_collection).
7. Once the collection is installed and enabled, check the notification center (top right) for any warnings. If there are notifications requiring deployment, approve them.
8. After all notifications are cleared and everything is enabled, you’re ready to launch the game!

**Note:** The modpack can currently be tested in **single-player** for now.

## Important Reminders:
Palworld is already known for bugs, and this modpack can introduce more instability. **Crashes are expected.** Please submit crash reports to the game studio—not to our GitHub issue tracker.
